I didn't know fully about the cleanTS package. I read about it from some resources. I can think of the following Updations in the cleanTS package. 

1. Make the code of Some functions(that are possible) in RCpp, so that the running time of the functions becomes fast.
2. Make a functions to give list of different types visualization possible with the given Univariate Data, that can give some inference.
3. Write the functions to do data cleaning for multivariate datasets.
4. Create functions for interactive , informative and animated plots to vistulize multivariate time series.(taking 2-3 variable at a time & implement plots by Plotly)
5. Add fuctions to make Statistical inferences about the data( I am learning the course Theroy of Statistics so, can say about it in detail).
6. Improve the Documentation of the existing functions and need to add stronly understandable documentation of new function.
7. We Can make the Shiny App shown by function interact_plot() more informative and more interactive.
8. We can add a function who follows a template and generate a readble document/text that gives information about the given dataset.

These are some updations I think can be implemented. I know some of them are not that good and there are many which I can not think of for now.
